# Bread Heads Inventory Manager

A simple app to manage a list of inventories.

Currently a very early work-in-progress; see current status in [our backlog](https://github.com/orgs/CMPUT301F23T09/projects/1) or [read the documentation on our wiki](https://github.com/CMPUT301F23T09/Bread-Heads/wiki).

## Setup

Compiling this project into a usable app requires hooking it up to a Firebase database via a `google-services.json` file. The `google-services.json` we use is currently included for ease of building. To use your own Firebase database, download its `google-services.json` file and add it to `/app/app/`, replacing the file already there.

## Attributions

This app was developed for CMPUT 301 at the University of Alberta in Fall 2023, based off many provided resources and user stories.
