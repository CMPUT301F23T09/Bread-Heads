# Bread Heads Inventory Manager

A simple app to manage an inventory. Inventories consist of a list of items with useful fields, including description, make, model, comment, and value. This list can be modified, filtered, and sorted.

Currently an early WIP. Basic list functionality is in place. Tag management is implemented on the backend but currently not functional in-app pending UI implementation. Attaching photos from galleries and retrieving them from Firestore is functional. We are working on expanding features to include:

* Better photo management
* Implementation of tags
* User profiles
* Revamped and improved UI with more visual clarity

For more information, please see current status in [our backlog](https://github.com/orgs/CMPUT301F23T09/projects/1) or [read the documentation on our wiki](https://github.com/CMPUT301F23T09/Bread-Heads/wiki).

## Setup

This app hooks into Firebase and uses both a Firestore database and an associated Firebase Storage.

Compiling this project into a usable app requires hooking it up to a Firebase database via a `google-services.json` file. The `google-services.json` we use is currently included for ease of building. To use your own Firebase database, download its `google-services.json` file and add it to `/app/app/`, replacing the file already there.

## Attributions

This app was developed for CMPUT 301 at the University of Alberta in Fall 2023, based off many provided resources and user stories. [Team information](https://github.com/CMPUT301F23T09/Bread-Heads/blob/main/doc/team.txt). Code adapted from other sources is cited where it appears, but in general we avoided using external code for this project. Some methods were adapted from provided examples in lab slides and exercises, however.

## Notes

Testing was primarily done using an emulated Pixel 2 or Pixel 3 with API configuration UpsideDownCakePrivacySandbox via Android Studio; however, physical testing was also done on a Galaxy S22+ over USB Debugging. We expect a minimum SDK of 26. In addition to the standard Android APIs, the project uses Firebase Firestore, Firebase Storage, JUnit/Espresso testing, Mockito, and [gson](https://github.com/google/gson); please make sure to Gradle sync before building if necessary. We also use JavaDoc for autogenerated documentation, and have precompiled the HTML in the `doc/JavaDoc` subdirectory. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) was used for collaboratively creating documentation diagrams.

A precompiled build APK `app-debug.apk` is included in case it is needed, but we recommend rebuilding in Android Studio and testing with that built APK instead. The precompiled APK may be out of date and is not tested.
